# P-vs-NP-proof-entropic-approach
A formal, constructive proof that P ≠ NP based on entropy-theoretic barriers and irreconstructibility constraints.

This repository presents a formally constructed proof that P is not equal to NP, using entropic principles and information-theoretic bounds. The approach defines a class of structured NP instances and demonstrates the existence of an entropic firewall — a surface beyond which uniform polynomial-time reconstruction becomes provably impossible. The result avoids reliance on relativization, natural proofs, or algebrization.
